I. Preprocessor.
  a) include   - include stage
    1) #include "file.blisp"    - include content from file and preprocess it. File include only ones.
    2) #native "function"       - native function prototype.

II. Language.
  a) bind      - binding something to his name.
    1) (bind a)                 - define variable a, and not set int value.
    2) (bind a 5)               - define variable a, and set it value to 5.
    3) (bind b a)               - define variable b, and set it value to a.
    4) (bind f (lambda () 5))   - define function f.
  b) lambda    - function defination.
    1) (lambda () )             - empty function. but it execute.
    2) (lambda (x) x)           - gives x argument and return it.
    3) (lambda (f) (f))         - gives f agrument and execute it. also return value.
    4) ((lambda () ))           - empty func execute.
    5) ((lambda (x) x) 5)       - execute with argument.
  c) operators - it is simple.
    1) (+ 2 3)                  - 2 + 3. "-", "*", "/" also supported.
    2) (+ 2 3 5)                - yes. we can write like this.
    3) (set a 5)                - set variable value to 5.
    5) (= 2 3)                  - compare to operands. "<", ">", "!=" also supported.
  d) stuff     - no comment.
    1) (if a c d)               - if(a == true) return c; else return d;
    2) (if a c)                 - if(a == true) return c; else return unknown thing;
    3) (while a (f))            - while(a == true) f();
    4) (array 5)                - define array with 5 elements. It is static variable.
    5) (get (array 3) 1)        - extract second item from array.
    6) (begin (+ 2 3) 5)        - container for many expressions.
  e) comments  - green lines here.
    1) // comment               - it is one line comment.
